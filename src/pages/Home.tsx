            I am a self-taught computer programmer, I code since my youngest age in various programming languages.
            <br />
            I became interested in web development later and learned html, javascript and css.
            <br /> 
            Afterwards, I became familiar with several frameworks like django, react-js and angular.
            I started as a freelancer at the beginning of May 2022.
